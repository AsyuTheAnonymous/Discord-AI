GitHub Repository Description:

This Python program serves as a critical bridge between OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Discord through a custom Discord bot. It enables users to obtain insightful responses related to bug bounty queries.

Key Features:

Continuous Operation: The program must run continuously, as it acts as a server facilitating communication between GPT-3.5 and Discord. Cutting off the program will result in a loss of communication with the bot.
Getting Started:

OpenAI API Key: Make sure to provide your OpenAI GPT-3.5 API key where indicated in the code. This key is essential for leveraging GPT-3.5's capabilities.

Discord Bot Token: Similarly, insert your unique Discord Bot Token into the code. You need to create a Discord bot, grant it text access within your chosen Discord channel, and use the token provided by Discord.

Usage: The bot is triggered by messages starting with !ask in the Discord channel. Users can ask bug bounty-related questions, and the bot will respond with detailed answers generated by GPT-3.5.
